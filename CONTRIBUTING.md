# Commit Message Guidelines

## Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header** and a **body**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type** and a **subject**:

```
<type>: <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
```

The **header** is mandatory.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

## Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

## Type
Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
* **content**: Changes in content of static files (.json data, images, etc)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feature**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **performance**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

## Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

## Body
The body should is the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
